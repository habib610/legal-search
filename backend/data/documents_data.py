        "In this plan, you need to pay the entire solar plant cost upfront. Additionally, PM Surya Ghar Yojna Subsidy, a government subsidy, helps you get a cashback of ₹18,000 per kW for solar plant sizes up to 500 kW. The regular payback period for solar panels is reduced to 1-2 years with the subsidy, down from 3-4 years without it",
